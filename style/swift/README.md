Swift
=====

[Sample](sample.swift)

* Keep up with the Objective-C style guide above. Will highlight differences
  here.
* Use `let` whenever possible to make immutable variables
* Name all parameters in functions and enum cases
* Use trailing closures
* Let the compiler infer the type whenever possible
* Group computed properties below stored properties
* Use a blank line above and below computed properties
* Group methods into specific extensions for each level of access control
* When capitalizing acronyms or initialisms, follow the capitalization of the
  first letter.
* Break up long initializers or function calls by adding linebreaks between
  arguments.
